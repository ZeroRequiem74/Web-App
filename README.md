# Overview

This code is a personal portfolio with a fun twist, it includes a game mechanic. When you open it using Node.js you will open a website called http://localhost:3000 and it will be a simple platforming game. There are two floating plateforms and three yellow squares along with a red square. The red square is the user and you can move it left and right and jump up with it. If the red square collides with one of the yellow squares it will redirect the user to a different page that has facts about myself such as my job experience, educations, and projects I have made.  

My purpose in makeing this was to make a portfolio that was both fun and showed off the programming skills I have.

# Web Pages

As I mentioned before the main page is the game and when you interact with the different yellow squares you go to the different pages of my portfolio. When in the different pages of my portfolio there is a highlight option to go back to the game and if you click it you will of course go back to the platforming game. On each of the portfolio pages is descriptions of different experiences as mentioned above.

# Development Environment

I used javascript to make this program and I used mainly websites I found on the internet or YouTube videos to help me create this program.

# Future Work

* I plan to edit the game to include better graphics, perhaps making it larger and adding enemies.
* I plan to edit the portfolio pages to be more aesthetically pleasing, including pictures and such.
